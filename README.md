# pubsub

pubsub offers three simple abstractions for running event-driven callbacks:

- interface `Register` to register event callbacks
- interface `Producer` to push events
- their implementation struct `Publisher`

See [example](https://github.com/jmdavril/pubsub/blob/master/examples/basic/main.go).
